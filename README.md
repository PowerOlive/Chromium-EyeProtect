# Discontinued Project / 此项目已放弃支持
This project has been discontinued due to google's cut off of third party Chromium sync support. [Related News](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-cuts-off-other-chromium-based-browsers-from-its-sync-service/)

Without sync support, there's no reason to keep using Chromium.

Chrome has never been an option, so I'm currently migrating to [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/business/download), if you're looking for an alternative too, why not give it a try :P

# Introduction / 简介
### English
Chromium-EyeProtect is a fork of [Chromium Browser](https://www.chromium.org/Home).

This fork was intended to rollback said "Refresh UI" to the legacy UI, which I think is nice and productive.

I know everyone has his/her own view about what UI is beautiful, therefore, if you like this project, I'd like to provide you with these patches or even pre-built binaries to "protect our eyes".

If you don't like it, you may simply close this page.


You can check [My Blog (Chinese)](https://blog.berd.moe/archives/chromium-eyeprotect/) for more details. To setup API Keys, please refer to [This Article](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/api-keys) or [My Blog (Chinese)](https://blog.berd.moe/archives/chromium-setup-api-keys/).

### 中文
Chromium-EyeProtect 是 [Chromium Browser](https://www.chromium.org/Home) 的一个分支.

该分支意在将所谓的 "Refresh UI" 回滚到我认为好看且高效的传统 UI

我知道每个人关于什么 UI 好看的观点各部相同, 因此, 如果你喜欢这个项目, 我很乐意给你提供这些补丁或者预编译的安装包来 "护眼".

如果你不喜欢这个项目, 你可以直接关闭本页面, **不需要尝试把你的观点强加在别人身上**.

# Building / 构建
Patches here are meant to be applied to Chromium official source directly.
The following steps shows you how to start from zero.
 1. Get chromium code following [This Guide](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/get-the-code)
 2. Checkout to the target version, each version in chromium repository have an corresponding tag
 3. Move to ___src___ directory and apply patches using `git apply <Patch Name>`
 4. Sync dependencies using `gclient sync -D --with_branch_heads --with_tags --force`
 5. Use `gn args out/Release` to modify build parameters
 6. In some scenarios, the gn won't wait for your editor to exit, so you have to run `gn gen out/Release` again after you modified parameters
 7. Finally, you can use `autoninja -C out/Release chrome` to build chromium
 8. If you want to get an installer (in windows), use `autoninja -C out/Release mini_installer` and pick up `mini_installer.exe` in Release directory.
